<p>The Research Group for Applied Education Technologies (referred to as AET in the following paragraphs) from the
  Technical University of Munich takes the protection of private data seriously. We process the automatically collected
  personal data obtained when you visit our website, in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations, in
  particular the Bavarian Data Protection (BayDSG), the Telemedia Act (TMG) and the General Data Protection Regulation
  (GDPR). Below, we inform you about the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data.</p>
<h2 id=logging>Logging</h2>
<p>The web servers of the AET are operated by the AET itself, based in Boltzmannstr. 3, 85748 Garching b. Munich. Every
  time our website is accessed, the web server temporarily processes the following information in log files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IP address of the requesting computer</li>
  <li>Date and time of access</li>
  <li>Name, URL and transferred data volume of the accessed file</li>
  <li>Access status (requested file transferred, not found etc.)</li>
  <li>Identification data of the browser and operating system used (if transmitted by the requesting web browser)</li>
  <li>Website from which access was made (if transmitted by the requesting web browser)</li>
</ul>
<p>The processing of the data in this log file takes place as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The log entries are continuously updated automatically evaluated in order to be able to detect attacks on the web
    server and react accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>In individual cases, i.e. in the case of reported disruptions, errors and security incidents, a manual analysis is
    carried out.
  </li>
  <li>The IP addresses contained in the log entries are not merged with other databases by AET, so that no conclusions
    can be drawn about individual persons.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our website can be used without providing personal data. All services that might require any form of personal data

  published as part of the imprint obligation by third parties to send unsolicited advertising and information material
  is hereby prohibited. The operators of the pages reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the
  unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam mails.</p>
<h2 id=revocation-of-your-consent-to-data-processing>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h2>
<p>Some data processing operations require your express consent possible. You can revoke your consent that you have
  already given at any time. A message by e-mail is sufficient for the revocation. The lawfulness of the data processing
  that took place up until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

  responsible supervisory authority</h2>
<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority in the event of a breach of data

  deletion</h2>
<p>You have at any time within the framework of the applicable legal provisions the right to request information about

  the lock symbol in the browser line.</p>
<h2 id=e-mail-security>E-mail security</h2>
<p>If you e-mail us, your e-mail address will only be used for correspondence with you. Please note that data
  transmission on the Internet can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not
